        <article><h1 id="ethernet-frame-data-parser-(asynchronous)">Ethernet Frame Data Parser (Asynchronous)</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you'll create and export a class that attaches
to a socket interface that presents a <code>stream.Readable</code>-compatible
interface to read a stream of binary network data and parse out
Ethernet frames as they occur, handling both the DIX Ethernet II
and IEEE 802.3 formats.</p>
<p>Ethernet frame addressing, being a data link layer protocol, uses a
point-to-point addressing scheme called the media access control (MAC)
addressing, a hardware-based addressing scheme that assigns a unique
identifier to each network interface controller (NIC), usually available
burned into the NIC's firmware.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h3 id="ethernet-packets%2C-ethernet-frames-and-the-inter-packet-gap">Ethernet Packets, Ethernet Frames and the Inter-packet Gap</h3>
<p>Ethernet lives on layer 2 (Data Link) of the layered network model,
but is transmitted over layer 1 (Physical). On the Physical layer,
Ethernet packets are transmitted over transmission media separated
by an inter-packet gap of minimum 12 bytes (octets). When designed, this
gap was intended to provide a delay between packets; now, however, a
12 byte gap provides minimal time delay, and acts simply as a separation
between packets. Because of this, in some cases, that gap is now reduced
to 8 bytes. (In this assignment, to simplify things, we'll only be concerned
with an inter-packet gap of at least 12 bytes.) Inter-packet gap looks
like idle signal, generally a high voltage level on the wire, or all <code>1</code>
bits. You can find idle signal by searching for repeated <code>FF</code> octets.</p>
<p>A new DIX Ethernet II packet is signified by a preamble of 8 bytes (octets)
of alternating 1s and 0s. In hexadecimal, this preamble is
<code>AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA</code>.</p>
<p>A new IEEE 802.3 Ethernet packet is signified by a preamble of 7 bytes
(octets) of alternating 1s and 0s, followed by a 1-byte
<em>start frame delimiter (SFD)</em> <code>10101011</code>. In hexadecimal, this preamble
and SFD sequence is <code>AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AB</code>.</p>
<p>An Ethernet frame is the layer 2 routing portion of the packet, and begins
immediately after the SFD.</p>
<p>So, to find an Ethernet frame in a stream of data, you'll need to first
identify the preamble (and SFD, if relevant). Then, capture from the octet
after the SFD until you see 12 or more octets of idle signal. The captured
packet can then be trimmed of the additional idle signal and parsed. Use the
frame check sequence to ensure that you've captured a complete frame.</p>
<p>To verify that you have captured the correct type of packet, you can inspect
the third field of the frame, which is the first differing field between the
two frame formats. In Ethernet II, this field is the EtherType, which will
always have a value greater than the maximum frame length of 1536 octets
(= <code>0x0600</code>). In IEEE 802.3, this field is the frame payload length, which
will always be less than the maximum length of 1500 octets. Thus, checking
that the field beginning immediately after the MAC addressing field (octets
12-13 of the frame) is greater than <code>0x0600</code> confirms that the frame is an
Ethernet II frame; otherwise, it is an IEEE 802.3 frame.</p>
<h2 id="your-assignment">Your Assignment</h2>
<p>To complete this assignment, you need to write the body of the <code>parseFrames</code>
function defined and exported from <code>index.js</code>. In addition, you'll need to
implement the <code>EthernetSocketProcessor</code>, an <code>EventEmitter</code> class that listens
to a socket and parses Ethernet frames as data arrives and emits them in
<code>data</code> events.</p>
<p>This processing is inherently asychronous. Sockets generally implement the
<code>streams.Readable</code> interface, so you can look at that class in the Node.js
documentation to get an idea of how data will come into your class.</p>
<p>Once you've found the frames that must be parsed, you'll use your frame
parser from assignment A1 to parse the fields out of the frame, so that you
can emit a parsed JavaScript object representing the frame's data.</p>
<h3 id="expected-output">Expected Output</h3>
<p>Your class should extend/implement either <code>events.EventEmitter</code> or one of the
writable <code>stream</code> classes (which implement <code>events.EventEmitter</code> already), and
emit 'data' events with the same JavaScript object structure as in Assignment A1
(included below, inside the array, as a reminder) as the event's message. The
exported function in <code>index.js</code> should also capture all frames parsed along the
way, and should return a JavaScript <code>Promise</code> object that resolves with an array
of those parsed frame objects once the socket is closed.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-{text}"><code>[
  {
    protocol: (either &quot;Ethernet II&quot; or &quot;IEEE 802.3&quot;),
    header: {
      destinationMAC: (MAC address binary value as length 6 Buffer),
      destination: (MAC Address human-readable text string),

    frame_check_valid: (Boolean, true if computed FCS matches)
  },
  ...
]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="program-structure">Program Structure</h3>
<p>While you must make your implementation pass automated tests that
will only use the exported <code>parseFrames</code> function and the
<code>EthernetSocketProcessor</code>, class you may want to add additional methods
or classes that assist in finding, segmenting and parsing the stream data.
Each of these functions should be well-tested (repeatably via automation),
so that you can be confident of the accuracy and error-free quality of
your parsing code. Each of these functions should also include relevant
documentation <a href="https://jsdoc.app/">in JSdoc format</a> about why they exist,
including expected inputs and outputs with data types. (Existing code
both here and in Assignment A1 are documented using this format, and some
documentation has already been written for you for the <code>EthernetSocketProcessor</code>
class, which you can use as a specification for what that class should do.)</p>
<p>In this repo, you will find a <code>lib</code> folder which contains several things
that should be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>EthernetSocketProcessor.js</code> - an empty module where you can create your
socket processor class that emits the appropriate events.</li>
<li><code>EthernetSocketProcessor.test.js</code> - a suite of tests to validate the
successful functioning of your socket processor class.</li>
</ul>
<p>This <code>lib</code> folder can also be used to house any new modules or classes you
write to support the operation of your <code>EthernetSocketProcessor</code> class. If
you add new files here, you should also add tests to validate their
correctness.</p>
<p>In addition to that, you'll find the main files in the repo root containing
helpful tests and starter code:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index.js</code> - the starting point for your class, which should <em>only</em> import and
export the class for use (the class should be created in its own module in <code>lib</code>).</li>
<li><code>index.test.js</code> - a suite of tests that will assess the correctness of your
your implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-note-on-working-with-asynchronous-events-and-streams-in-javascript">A note on working with asynchronous events and streams in JavaScript</h4>
<p>In this assignment, you'll be working with binary data coming into your
class through a mock network socket which is a subclass of the <code>stream.Readable</code>
class in JavaScript. Data pushed over the this mock socket will be in the form
of binary data <code>Buffer</code> objects. There are several ways to handle <code>stream</code>-based data,
which you can learn about
<a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/stream.html">in the Node.js docs on <code>Stream</code></a>.</p>
<p>The output of your class should be communicated by emitting JavaScript <code>events</code>.
You can learn more about working with events
<a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/events.html">in the Node.js docs on <code>Events</code></a>.</p>
<p>Because the output of your class will need to emit events, you may want to try
<a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html">making your class subclass <code>EventEmitter</code></a>,
and then using the event-based reading mode of the input <code>stream.Readable</code>-compatible class,
adding listeners for relevant events to get the input data from the mock network socket.</p>
<h4 id="getting-started-on-the-assignment">Getting started on the assignment</h4>
<p>As with Assignment A1, in order to get started with the assignment, you'll want
to do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Review this assignment description in detail</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore JavaScript <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/events.html">Events and <code>EventEmitter</code></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore JavaScript <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams">Readable Streams</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone this repo to your computer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new folder <code>.github</code> and a subfolder <code>workflows</code> within it. Copy the <code>node.js.yml</code> file
from the root of the repository into that new subfolder. This will enable automated test runs
when you push commits to Github which will show up as part of your pull request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read through the comments and code included for you, particularly in <code>index.js</code> and <code>lib/EthernetSocketProcessor.js</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <strong>your completed Assignment A1 Ethernet parser library</strong> as a dependency of your project
by using <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#git-urls-as-dependencies">the NPM <code>package.json</code> syntax for Github-based package dependencies</a>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-{text}"><code>git+ssh://git@github.com:npm/cli.git#branch-or-tag-name
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that this expects that you've already <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">setup SSH-based command line Github access</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following at the command line from within the project directory (use <code>cd &lt;path&gt;</code>, replacing
<code>&lt;path&gt;</code> with the folder path to your project directory, to get there):</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-{sh}"><code>nvm use 18.17
npm install
npm test
</code></pre>
<p>To look at test coverage for what you've written, you can also run:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-{sh}"><code>npm run coverage
</code></pre>
<p>This assignment will also automatically check your code style for readability. To run those
tests at your own command line, you can use:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-{sh}"><code>npm run lint
</code></pre>
<p>To regenerate documentation for this project, you can run the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-{sh}"><code>npm run docs
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission-and-feedback">Submission and Feedback</h3>
<p>You must submit your changes as commits to a new branch of your creation in the
repository. Commits to the <code>master</code> branch will not be reviewed. Please follow
appropriate naming conventions for git branches: alpha-numeric characters plus
<code>-</code>, <code>_</code>, and <code>/</code>, with branch name conveying meaning related to your changes.</p>
<p>Once you have a new branch and have pushed that branch to Github, you will need
to create a new Pull Request based on that branch compared against the <code>master</code>
branch. As you push your commits on the new branch up to Github, they
will be added to the activity on this pull request. You can create this pull request
in either Draft or normal mode at your discretion.</p>
<p>In addition to the synchronous mechanism of requesting help via office hours
appointments, this pull request will be your mechanism for asking questions and
requesting help asynchronously during the course of this assignment. I will also
use this pull request to provide feedback on your work. I will provide feedback on
the completed assignment within a week of the due date of the assignment.
If you push your code earlier than the due date, I will try to provide
feedback as needed earlier.</p>
<p>I suggest that you push your work to Github as you make commits, and that you make
commits frequently as you work on the assignment. This way, if you have questions,
I will be able to review your work-in-progress and give more relevant answers and
feedback. If you have a question specific to a particular area of the code, note that
you can add comments inline on the pull request by clicking on the <strong>Files changed</strong> tab
of the pull request, then clicking the little blue <code>+</code> icon that appears when you hover
over a specific line of code. You can also select multiple lines by clicking on a line
number to highlight it, then shift-clicking on a line somewhere below it to highlight
the block. Once that set of code is highlighted, you can click the <code>+</code> icon on the last
line of the block to add a comment that references the entire selected block of code.</p>
<p>I will do my best to respond to questions posed during the course of the assignment with
in a day of the ask. <strong>If you want to ask a question or request early feedback, please tag
me in a comment on the pull request: <code>@nihonjinrxs</code>.</strong></p>
<p>Good luck, and I look forward to seeing what you create!</p></article>
